## API Resources

When building an HTTP based API, you often need a transformation layer that sits between your models
and the JSON (or XML, etc) responses that are actually returned to API consumers.

The API resource classes allow you to transform your models into HTTP Responses (JSON, XML, etc).

> This project was inspired by the Laravel [API Resources](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/eloquent-resources)
> concept. The goal is to make this approach available in non-Laravel applications as well.
